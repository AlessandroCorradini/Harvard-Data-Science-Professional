# Data Science: Probability - PH125.3x

<br/>

## Overview
[Data Science: Probability](https://www.edx.org/course/r-probability-2) is the third of nine courses for the [Professional Certificate Program in Data Science](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science) taught by the famous Prof. of Biostatistics Rafael Irizarry from Harvard University through [edX platform](https://www.edx.org).

This course covers:

- Important concepts in probability theory including random variables and independence
- How to perform a Monte Carlo simulation
- The meaning of expected values and standard errors and how to compute them in R
- The importance of the Central Limit Theorem
