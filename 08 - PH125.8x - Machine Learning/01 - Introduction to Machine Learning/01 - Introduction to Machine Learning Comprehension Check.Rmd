## **Introduction to Machine Learning**
### **Question 1**

"Turbochamp" was one of the first algorithms written by famed British computer scientist, mathematician and crypto-analyst Alan Turing in the late 1940s. The artificial intelligence program was based on programmable rules derived from theory or first principles and could 'think' two moves ahead.

True or False: A key feature of machine learning is that the algorithms are built on data.

- True [X]
- False

<br/>

### **Question 2**

True or False: In machine learning, we build algorithms that take feature values (X) and train a model using known outcomes (Y) that is then used to predict outcomes when presented with features without known outcomes.

- True [X]
- False
