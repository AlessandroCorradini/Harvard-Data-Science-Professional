## **Vector lengths**
When analyzing data it's often important to know the number of measurements you have for each category.

**Instructions**

- Define a variable ```male``` that contains the male heights.
- Define a variable ```female``` that contains the female heights.
- Report the length of each variable.

```{r, include=TRUE}
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
male <- heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"]
female <- heights$height[heights$sex=="Female"]
length(male)
length(female)
```

<br/>

## **Percentiles**
Suppose we can't make a plot and want to compare the distributions side by side. If the number of data points is large, listing all the numbers is inpractical. A more practical approach is to look at the percentiles. We can obtain percentiles using the ```quantile``` function like this

```
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
quantile(heights$height, seq(.01, 0.99, 0.01))
```

**Instructions**

- Create two five row vectors showing the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, and 90th percentiles for the heights of each sex called these vectors ```female_percentiles``` and ```male_percentiles```.
- Then create a data frame called ```df``` with these two vectors as columns. The column names should be ```female``` and ```male``` and should appear in that order. As an example consider that if you want a data frame to have column names ```names``` and ```grades```, in that order, you do it like this:

```
df <- data.frame(names = c("Jose", "Mary"), grades = c("B", "A"))
```
- Take a look at the ```df``` by printing it. This will provide some information on how male and female heights differ.

```{r, include=TRUE}
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
male <- heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"]
female <- heights$height[heights$sex=="Female"]

male_percentiles <- quantile(male, c(.1,.3,.5,.7,.9))
female_percentiles <- quantile(female, c(.1,.3,.5,.7,.9))

df <- data.frame(female = female_percentiles, male = male_percentiles)

print(df)
```
