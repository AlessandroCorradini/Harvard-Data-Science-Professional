![](ex-2.png)

**Instructions**

Possible Answers

- The values are wrong. The final vote was 306 to 232.
- The axis does not start at 0. Judging by the length, it appears Trump received 3 times as many votes when in fact it was about 30% more. [X]
- The colors should be the same.
- Percentages should be shown as a pie chart.

**Instructions**

Possible Answers

- Both plots provide the same information, so they are equally good.
- The plot on the left is better because it orders the states alphabetically.
- The plot on the right is better because it orders the states by disease rate so we can quickly see the states with highest and lowest rates. [X]
- Both plots should be pie charts instead.
