# Data Science: Inference and Modelling - PH125.4x

<br/>

## Overview
[Data Science: Inference and Modelling](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-inference-and-modeling-2) is the fourth of nine courses for the [Professional Certificate Program in Data Science](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science) taught by the famous Prof. of Biostatistics Rafael Irizarry from Harvard University through [edX platform](https://www.edx.org).

This course covers:

- The concepts necessary to define estimates and margins of errors of populations, parameters, estimates and standard errors in order to make predictions about data
- How to use models to aggregate data from different sources
- The very basics of Bayesian statistics and predictive modeling
