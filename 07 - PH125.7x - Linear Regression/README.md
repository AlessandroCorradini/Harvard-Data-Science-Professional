# Data Science: Linear Regression - PH125.7x

## Overview
[Data Science: Linear Regression](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-machine-learning) is the seventh of nine courses for the [Professional Certificate Program in Data Science](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science) taught by the famous Prof. of Biostatistics Rafael Irizarry from Harvard University through [edX platform](https://www.edx.org).

This course cover:
- The basics of machine learning
- How to perform cross-validation to avoid overtraining
- Several popular machine learning algorithms
- How to build a recommendation system
- What is regularization and why it is useful?
