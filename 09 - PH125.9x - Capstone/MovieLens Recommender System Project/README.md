# MovieLens Reccomender System Project

## Introduction

For this project, you will be creating a movie recommendation system 
using  the MovieLens dataset. The version of movielens included in the 
dslabs package(which was used for some of the exercises in PH125.8x: Data 
Science: Machine Learning) is just a small subset of a much larger 
dataset with millions of ratings. You can find the entire latest 
MovieLens dataset here. You will be creating your own recommendation 
system using all the tools we have shown you throughout the courses 
in this series. We will use the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset 
to make the computation a little easier.

You will download the MovieLens data and run code we will provide to 
generate your datasets.

First, there will be a short quiz on the MovieLens data. You can view 
this quiz as an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the data in order 
to prepare for your project submission.

Second, you will train a machine learning algorithm using the inputs 
in one subset to predict movie ratings in the validation set. 
Your project itself will be assessed by peer grading.

## Instruction

The submission for the MovieLens project will be three files: a report 
in the form of an Rmd file, a report in the form of a PDF document knit 
from your Rmd file, and an R script or Rmd file that generates your 
predicted movie ratings and calculates RMSE. Your grade for the project 
will be based on two factors:
 
- Your report and script (75%)
- The RMSE returned by testing your algorithm on the validation set (25%)

Please note that once you submit your project, you will not be able to make 
changes to your submission.

**Report and Script (75%)**

Your report and script will be graded by your peers, based on a rubric 
defined by the course staff. Each submission will be graded by three peers 
and the median grade will be awarded. To receive your grade, you must review 
and grade the submissions of five of your fellow learners after 
submitting your own. This will give you the chance to learn from your peers. 
Take note of the deadline as you must grade the reports of your peers by 
this deadline in order to receive your grade.

**RMSE (25%)**

Your movie rating predictions will be compared to the true ratings in the 
validation set using RMSE. Be sure that your report includes the RMSE 
and that your R script outputs the RMSE.
