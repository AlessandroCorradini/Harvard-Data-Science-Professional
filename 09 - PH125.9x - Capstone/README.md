# Harvard Data Science Professional Capstone - PH125.9x

[Data Science: Capstone](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-capstone) is the final course for the [Professional Certificate Program in Data Science](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science) taught by the famous Prof. of Biostatistics Rafael Irizarry from Harvard University through [edX platform](https://www.edx.org).

This capstone project cover:

- How to apply the knowledge base and skills learned throughout the series to a real-world problem
- How to independently work on a data analysis project

## Projects

- MovieLens Recommender System
- Second Project

<br/>

## Instruction

### 1. Build a recommender system based on MovieLens database that predict movie ratings.

The submission for the MovieLens project will be four files: a report in the form of a PDF document, a report in the form of an Rmd file, an R script or Rmd file that generates your predicted movie ratings, and a submission file submission.csv containing your predicted movie ratings. Your grade for the project will be based on two factors:

1.  Your report and script (75%)
2.  The accuracy of your algorithm (25%)

**Report and Script (75%)**

Your report and script will be graded by your peers, based on a rubric defined by the course staff. Each submission will be graded by three peers and the median grade will be awarded. To receive your grade, you must review and grade the submissions of five of your fellow learners after submitting your own. This will give you the chance to learn from your peers. Take note of the deadline as you must grade the reports of your peers by this deadline in order to receive your grade.

When grading, you will run the submission code to confirm that the output corresponds to the contents of the submission file submission.csv.

**Accuracy (25%)**

Your movie rating predictions will be graded for accuracy by your peers using an automated grading script. Accuracy lower than 0.50 gets 0/25, accuracy between 0.50 and 0.74 gets 10/25, accuracy between 0.75 and 0.84 gets 15/25, accuracy between 0.85 and 0.94 gets 20/25, and accuracy of 0.95 or greater gets 25/25.

### 2. Second Project choosen in complete autonomy

For this project, you will be creating a supervised machine learning algorithm using techniques that go beyond standard linear regression. You will have the opportunity to use a publicly available dataset to solve the problem of your choice. The [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) are good places to seek out a dataset. Kaggle also maintains a [curated list of datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/ml-friendly-public-datasets?utm_medium=email&utm_source=intercom&utm_campaign=data+projects+onboarding)  that are cleaned and ready for machine learning analyses.

The ability to clearly communicate the process and insights gained from an analysis is an important skill for data scientists. You will submit a report that documents your analysis and presents your findings, with supporting statistics and figures. The report must be written in English and uploaded as both a PDF document and an Rmd file. Although the exact format is up to you, the report should include the following at a minimum:

-   an introduction/overview/executive summary section that describes the dataset and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed;
-   a methods/analysis section that explains the process and techniques used, such as data cleaning, data exploration and visualization, any insights gained, and your modeling approach;
-   a results section; and
-   a conclusion section.

Your project submission will be graded both by your peers and by a staff member. The peer grading will give you an opportunity to check out the projects done by other learners.
